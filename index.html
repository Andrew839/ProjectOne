    <p>I am a student at San Francisco State University, currently majoring in visual communications design, <br>
    and minoring in theatre arts; this is my third year here, and I have one more year left. <br>
    I live in South San Francisco, which is around 15 minutes away from San Francisco, <br>
    neighboring cities like San Bruno and Daly City. </p>
    <p>I have quite the amount of things I like to do, and honestly I had no idea I had this many hobbies until recently. <br>
    I like to play and watch sports, though as of late I have been doing more of the latter than the former. <br>
    I am into basketball in particular, and I like to watch the Golden State Warriors as they are the local NBA team, <br>
    however I do like to watch the NBA as a whole because I just like watching people play basketball, <br>
    as someone who has been in the players' position (to an extent) in the past. </p>
    <p>Another hobby I have is playing video games, and they have been a huge part of my life. <br>
    I have been playing video games since I was a child, around the age of probably 8 or 9 years old. <br>
    I like to play a variety of games, but I am particularly fond of RPGs, due to the stories they tell. <br>
    <p>Speaking of stories, I also read books, but as of late I haven't gotten the time because of school work. <br>
    I like to read fantasy novels, and I have read a lot of them: <br>
    for example, the Percy Jackson series, the Harry Potter series, and the Inheritance Cycle series to name a few. <br>
    But I read those all in the past, and I am not entirely sure why I stopped, and am looking to pick them up again when I can. </p>
    <p>Some other things about me are that I also watch anime, listen to music and of course, I like food. <br> 
    Because it's delicious. Most of the time. Anyways, that's besides the point. <br>
    All of these things I have listed are what have helped me become who I am, <br>
    not just as a person overall, but as a creative person who has now rediscovered that side to him, <br>
    and is now looking to fully immerse himself in that world and its various subworlds.</p>
