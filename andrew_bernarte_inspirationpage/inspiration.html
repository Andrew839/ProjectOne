    <h3>His game interfaces really emphasize with his use of color what the atmosphere of the game is,<br>
        and it is a good reminder this is something I can eventually make as someone who aspires to be a designer for video games.</h3>

    <h3>His performances for his characters, especially the above character, Geralt of Rivia, <br>
    are what re-awakened my creative side and are a part of why I seek to explore more of it, <br>
    hence why I seek to use that as I get closer to my video game design career.</h3>

    <h3>His writings are what first awakened my creative side, as I loved his storytelling as a younger child; <br>
    as I have learned more about design, I have come to realize it is also about storytelling, not just making something nice, <br>
    and so in the future, when I design for future projects, I must also have my designs tell a story.</h3>
